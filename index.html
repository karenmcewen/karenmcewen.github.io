									<p>Welcome to my current portfolio of work.  Like me, it is a work that is still in process.</p>
                                    <h3>Act 1</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        I began my journey as a Physics major at the College of Wooster. I did a senior thesis project there that has become one of the primary research areas in the department.
                                        I received a National Science Foundation Fellowship, went on to receive degrees in Applied Mathematics and Environmental Engineering from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
                                        A native Clevelander, I returned to the area as an Environmental Engineer, with a specialty in environmental contaminant modeling and human health risk assessment.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Act 2</h3>
									<p>
                                    Science and mathematics explain how the world works.  They are the primary lens through which we view the world, and provide the source for progress and technology. 
                                   After a family tragedy, I became more interested in the questions of "Why?", and "How shall we live our lives?" 
                                    I left engineering for the practice of ministry.  I received a Master of Divinity degree from Eden Theological Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri.
                                   After graduation, I returned to Cleveland to serve in Global Ministries, at the National Headquarters of the United Church of Christ.
                                    I went on to serve three churches as an ordained minister, specializing in congregations that were in transition. 
                                    They were seeking to redevelop, merge with other congregations, or close.  Being successful meant leading them through planning and visioning processes for 2-5 years, and then leaving them to the move forward with their chosen focus.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Act 3</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    As my third ministry was coming to an end, I began to reimagine my own journey.  
                                    I was always the go-to person for data analysis in the churches and nonprofits with which I worked.  Where most people see numbers (and often close their eyes), I see a story and opportunity.
                                    A rabbi acquaintance had attended a coding bootcamp in the area, and successfully retrained as a computer programmer.  She encouraged me to look into it, and I did.  </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In August, 2017, I began attending We Can {Code} IT, an intensive coding bootcamp in Cleveland, Ohio.  Admittedly, I was nervous about tackling the new technology that had become available in the years since I left engineering.
                                        What I found was a whole new world, and I *LOVE* IT.  I love learning new things, and I take great pleasure in making sense out of things that may not, at first, make sense.
                                        I rediscovered, especially, my enjoyment of data analysis (yes, some of us find it fun), and the incredible opportunity it provides.  More data has become available in the last few years than from the dawn of time.
                                        There is an amazing wealth of knowledge available, just waiting to be teased apart and understood.  </p>
                                    <h3>Act 3.1415926535...</h3>
                                    <p>
                                   In January, 2018, I will complete my program at We Can {Code} IT, as well as an online program in data analysis.  With my background in multiple fields, 
                                        I look forward to sharing my skills, education, and experience in the field of data science.  Together with the right partners, I intend to make a difference in how you see your business, and to use that knowledge to make a difference in the world.
                                        Every point has a story.  Is your data being heard?
