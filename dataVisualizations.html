                        I created this logo using Tableau, as a visualization of a part of my own story.  <br />
                        The data source is the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES.gov), numbers of
                        Master's Degrees awarded in Engineering for both men and women, between 1950-2012.<br />
                        Each bubble dot represents the percentage of those degrees which were awarded to women each year. They are ordered by year, with the innermost (and smallest) being the earliest data from 1952
                        Each year's new bubble is placed in a clockwise fashion, with the size and color indicative of the approximate percentation of women who received Master's degrees in engineering that year.
                        <br />
                        Key: Blue (1-5%) * purple (6-10%) * salmon (my cohort - approximately 15%) * orange (15-20%) * red (20-23%).

                            </header>
                            <p>Lorain Cooperative Ministry is a nonprofit cooperative of 9 member churches which provide
                            hot meals and/or food pantries to people in need in Lorain County. <br/>
                            I sat on the Board from 2012-2017, and served as Board Secretary and Executive Board Member for part of that time. <br/>
                            The agency celebrated 30 years of service to the community, but had not published any measurements of success.
                            I researched the data and did simple analyzation on the number of clients served and the funding sources,
                            and created their first Annual Report in 2013 which we were able to share with donors and potential funders.

                            </header>
                            <p>The Book of Psalms is a collection of 150 poems, hymns, laments, and liturgical elements that were written of the course of approximately 700 years, from 1100-400 BCE.<br/>
                            As part of a seminary project, I analysed the psalms using various techniques, and created a piece of liturgical artwork that could be worn as a stole during worship. <br/>
                            Each color represents a particular form, i.e., blue represents laments, while yellow represent psalms of praise and thanksgiving. The length
                           of each psalm is represented by width (1 inch = 20 verses).  Together, the artwork provides a visual representation of the whole.
                            </p>
